    The JSON should be saved as a JSON file (menu.json) and should be an object ({}) representing the entirety of your menu.
    Your menu JSON should consist of multiple properties, each one an array, represent the array of options available for:
        appetizers
        cold sandwiches
        hot sandwiches
        desserts
        drinks
    Each item in each array should be an object consisting of 3 properties:
        name of the item/sandwich
        an array of strings representing the ingredients
        a string description.
    You must have at least 2 items (objects) on each submenu (appetizers, cold sands, hot sands, desserts, and drinks)

While you're writing out your JSON, it might help to periodically paste your JSON into JSONlint to validate that the syntax is correct.
