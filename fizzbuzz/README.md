Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.

For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
Example:

1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
buzz
11
fizz
13
14
fizzbuzz
16
ect.
Optional:

    Write a function that keeps a tally of how often the phrases "fizz","buzz", and "fizzbuzz" occur in the array returned from the previous function.
    It should return an object that looks like this:

{ 
    fizzbuzz: 6, 
    fizz: 27, 
    buzz: 14 
}
