Use it as a springboard for your own Mom's shopping list app. The todos that are already in the HTML are there only to give an example of what the ones created in Part 1 should look like. Delete them from the HTML and make sure your code still works before moving on to Part 2.    


Parts

Each part is it's own task. It would be beneficial to have someone look at your code before moving from one part to the next.
Part 1

    A user will be able to add list items to the pre-built ul using the pre-built form
    New list items should have the same format as the li's that came with the git repo

Part 2

    A user will be able to delete items using an items delete button

Extra Credit

    A user will be able to click the "edit" button and see an input box appear
    When the user clicks the "edit" button, a "save" button replace the "edit" button
    The input box will automatically have the value of the list item
    The user can edit and "save" the input box's value
    On save, the input box will disappear, and the new value will appear
